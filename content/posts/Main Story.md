Intro:

At an age where the human beings are extinct, earth passed on the human intelligence to the Felines. From pets of the humans to being self-aware, their evolution was foretold by the great human sages. They were not the only species to become self-aware, there were Lupines. 
From loners to becoming a society of human-like warriors, Lupines evolved rather quickly over the Felines. 

Every decade for the past five centuries have been an unending battle between the felines and the lupines. The Felines possess a vast library of knowledge which the Lupines wish to use for greed. No one knew what information the library possessed; The language was in old english and there was no creature alive to decipher it. But once a feline was born to understand the language, the war between the two began.

There is a prophecy foretold which said: By the fifth century an alliance would be formed between the two to battle the unknown and peace would last forever.

“Bakeneko” said the mother. Mr. and Mrs. Mew had their first child. 
”You will be the one who can find peace” continued Mrs. Mew.
”I don’t believe in such nonsense. I like the name, we shall keep it.” said Mr. Mew.
”There you go, there are more things in this world other than science.”
”Let’s stop there. I hate to argue on this.”

“Let’s.”

Dr. Leia said “She is a beautiful baby. Congratulations Dad and Mom!”

Mr & Mrs. Mew replied in unison “Thank you!”

Bakeneko, a name given to the mythical cat which could see the future. Mrs. Mew was highly superstitious. She truly believed her daughter would save the world. Mr. Mew on the other hand was the most logical person you could meet.

As the years grew by, numerous battles erupted between the Felines and the Lupines. Bakeneko was crowned the princess of the Kingdom and lead the wars to find peace. But the Lupines would never stop.

”Neko” said the queen. “You must take rest from these endless battles. They have no end!”

“No, Mom. The Lupines need learn that peace is greater than greed”

“I know I put a lot of pressure on you by naming you to be a keeper of foresight and peace, but I was wrong”
”We will find peace, Mom, I know we will”
The princess walked away.
