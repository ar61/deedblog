It had been over a fortnight since it began. 

There was fire all around her. She heard multiple swords clashing and bashing. The fire was very hot and scathing her skin slowly. The agonising pain was unbearable. Just then, a Lupine appeared and carried her to safety.

This was the nightmare she saw every night.
